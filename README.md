# Steam Level Calculator

This is a small tool to check how much XP and how many badge sets you need to reach any Steam level â€” up to 10,000. It also gives you a rough price estimate.

## What it does

It runs fully in your browser. No login, no backend, no tracking.

You just enter your current and target level. It calculates:

- total XP needed
- how many sets that is
- rough cost (depends on market prices)
- what kind of Steam perks you get at that level

The XP calculation matches how Valve scales levels (every 10 levels the XP step goes up). Should be pretty accurate for planning.

## Why I made this

Honestly, I just got tired of using weird Steam tools or badge bots that take forever or feel outdated. I wanted something fast and minimal â€“ so I built this.

The logic is inside a single React component. No servers, no clutter. Just works.
